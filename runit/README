This is a runit directory for abuse_mail_monitor.rb

In ``run``, edit INSTALL_DIR:

  * INSTALL_DIR is the full path to where this project lives.  It is used to
    find abuse_mail_monitor.rb

Enable as follows:

::

  ln -s <INSTALL_DIR>/runit /etc/sv/abuse-mail-monitor

OR

I've seen /etc/service being used instead of /etc/sv on newer Ubuntu's:

::

  ln -s <INSTALL_DIR>/runit /etc/service/abuse-mail-monitor
