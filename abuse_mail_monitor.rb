# When we receive complaints of abuse (e.g. SPAM, DoS attack, etc...) and that
# abuse can be identified as originating from a particular IP address, we
# forward the complaint to a special email address monitored by this script.
# This monitor can then lookup the customer / owner of the IP and forward the
# complaint.
